Each inventory must always have at least one admin, and the total number of users cannot exceed five.

Admins cannot demote themselves unless a backup manager is in place to maintain leadership. Additionally, an admin cannot leave the inventory if they are the sole user remaining. However, if necessary, the admin holds the authority to delete the entire inventory, ensuring complete control over the inventory lifecycle."
